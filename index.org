#+title: A Look at Loan-to-Deposits
#+author: Matt Brigida
#+SETUPFILE: https://fniessen.github.io/org-html-themes/org/theme-readtheorg.setup

I use:

#+begin_quote
"Net loans and leases to deposits","lnlsdepr","Loans and lease financing receivables net of unearned income, allowances and reserves as a percent of total deposits."
#+end_quote

as the measure of loans and leases to deposits.

import seaborn as sns
sns.set_theme(style="darkgrid")
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use("dark_background")

panel = pd.read_csv('../../../1_FDIC_SDI_data/build_panel/panel_python_20210630/5_full_panel_with_state_etc.csv', header=0, sep=",", low_memory=False)

panel['quarter'] = pd.to_datetime(panel['quarter'])

## "Net loans and leases to deposits","lnlsdepr","Loans and lease financing receivables net of unearned income, allowances and reserves as a percent of total deposits."

print(panel["lnlsdepr"].describe())

## only keep values between -1 and 2 (remember to remove for while panel)
loans_to_deposits_censored = panel["lnlsdepr"].where(panel["lnlsdepr"] > -100)
loans_to_deposits_censored = panel["lnlsdepr"].where(panel["lnlsdepr"] < 200)

## look at median and mean lnlsdepr over time (also look at firm size)
